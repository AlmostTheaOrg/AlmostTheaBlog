Specifics:
The album is a container for multiple pictures(atleast one picture should be available). Every picture has exactly one genre.
The album has multiple genres because it may contain pictures with different genres.
Every album will have a header picture(alongside with album's title) which will lead us to album view from which we can se all of album's entities.
From there we should be able to see all pictures in current album. We should load every single picture view.

-Admin - has Normal user rights and it can perform CRUD operations over albums/pictures
	Search
- by album/picture title

	Genres section
- for every available Genre we should display every picture which belongs there.
